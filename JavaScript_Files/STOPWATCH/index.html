                <h4>About the <i>STOPWATCH</i></h4><br>
                <p><i>STOPWATCH</i> serves as the tool to measure time in various contidions and environments. There are several unique to the application tools that might help you when using it.</p>
                <p><span class="tool">Current Time</span> - represents the currently measured time. It can be stopped, reseted, and inserted to Time List.</p>
                <p><span class="tool">Total Time</span> - represents the measured time by total including the latest measured time and the previous ones. Unlike Current Time, it cannot be affected either by resetting or inserting processes.</p>
                <p><span class="tool">Buttons</span> - are localized on the right top corner of the panel. Each has a different function:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="tool">Start Stopwatch/Stop Stopwatch</span> - are responsible for initiation and halt of the stopwatch, affecting both Current Time and Total Time. Clicking the button when Start Stopwatch is ready starts the Times and switches the button text to Stop Stopwatch. Doing the opposite stops the Times and returns the button text back to Start Stopwatch.</li>
                    <li><span class="tool">Reset Stopwatch</span> - is responsible for reset of Current Time stopwatch. When clicked, it resets the time back to '00:00:00:000' value and automatically starts the new measurement. Total Time is not affected by this button.</li>
                    <li><span class="tool">Add Stopwatch Measurement</span> - is responsible for inserting the measurement from Current Time. When clicked, it copies the measurement for Current Time and places into Time List followed by committing Reset Stopwatch function. If the button is used when a timer has value equal '00:00:00:00', a respective error will appear. Some extra actions might occur in Time List and Shortest Time Recorded blocks if meet their requirements.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><span class="tool">Time List</span> - shows all collected time measurements placed using the Add Stopwatch Measurement button in order from oldest to newest. It has a capacity of 100 measurements and must not exceed this; otherwise a corresponding error will appear. Some displayed measurements also appear with different backgrounds when they belong to the 3 shortest of the current Time List measurements, where the shortest has a gold background, the second shortest has a silver background and the third shortest has a brown background. The Top 3 is intended to collate the 3 shortest measurements , however, if 2 or more measurements have reached an identical time, then they are given an equal position and the position(s) below are ignored.</p>
                <p><span class="tool">Shortest Time Recorded</span> - shows the currently shortest time measurement recorded.</p><br>
